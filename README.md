# Overview

Explore National Parks of Japan is a mobile-first one-page website that aims to users that love travelling, outdoors and enjoy adventures in nature.
The website is designed to be pleasing to the eye and to provide useful information about the most beautiful national parks in Japan, how to get there and to provide weather information.
The main goal of the website is to promote beautiful national parks Japan has to offer and to inspire people to travel and experience different culture.

The website was created as a **Milestone Project 2** as a part of **Diploma in Full Stack Software Development** with **Code Institute**. The project is developed using HTML, JavaScript and CSS programs.

# User Experience (UX)

## Strategy

The user experience is simple and easy to use with an effective and clear navigation experience.

### Project Goals

- To enable easy access to the information needed about national parks to plan the trip.
- To show the information about the most beautiful Japan's national parks to visit.
- To provide the information on how to get there.
- To ensure the users can get live weather forecast.
- The content provided is relevant and regularly updated.

## Scope

- Fully responsive single page mobile first website.
- The use of APIs to show relevant information to the user.
- Interactive features that allow the user to engage and find needed information.
- An easy-to-use contact form that sends emails to the owner using EmailJS.

## Structure

The website will be designed to be pleasing to the eye, consistent and user friendly.
- Interaction Design
    - Consistent design will be used throughout the website to maintain a good UX.
    - The overlay navigation with effective background image will make the website look elegant and attractive.
    - The users will be able to interact with Google Map by clicking on the map markers. Additionally, when selecting a national park from a dropdown list, weather data will get displayed.

- Information Architecture (IA)
    - The project was conceptualized as a single page website, divided in four sections. This structure was used because it is simple and familiar to the site visitors and it is sufficient for all user stories.
    - Short paragraphs providing the relevant information will be used. This approach was selected to provide enough information, yet not to overwhelm.
    - The content is organized and categorized by importance from top to bottom and left to right.

## Skeleton
The wireframes were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
Please view the wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile screens on the following link:
[Explore National Park of Japan wireframes](https://github.com/FruitbatM/explore-national-parks-of-japan/blob/master/readme-files/wireframes/MS2-wireframes.pdf).

## Design

### Color Scheme

The traditional colors of Japan will be used for the project, primarily variations of red and white.

- Venetian Red (#C60A09)
- White (#FFFFFF)
- Red Pigment (#F23332)
- Seashell (#FFEFEB)
- Melon (#F9C5B8)
- Dark Red (#960807)

<h2 align="center"><img src="readme-files/img-readme/explore-japan-color-palette.jpg" alt="color palette" target="_blank" width="75%" height="75%"></h2>

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a color palette.

A Venetian Red (#C60A09) color will be used for hero text background, social media icons, headings, button and for footer section. According to the article [The Traditional colors of Japan](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/color-in-japan/) red color is associated with authority, ambition and determination.

White (#FFFFFF) and Seashell (#FFEFEB) colors will be used primarily as background colors interchangeably to differentiate different website sections, respectively. Also, white will be used for navigation section.
A white color is light, neutral, and combining it with red it speaks of love and passion. Seashell color will be used because of its light note and closeness to cherry blossom color which is a symbolic flower of Japan.

Melon (#F9C5B8) and Dark Red (#960807) colors will be only used under Weather section. This combination will be used due to contrast between the foreground and background.

### Fonts

- Two fonts will be used throughout the project, **Crimson Pro** and **Work Sans**. Crimson Pro will be used with ``serif`` font as a fallback and Work Sans will be used with ``sans-serif`` font as a fallback.
**Crimson Pro** will be used for the main headings and **Work Sans** will be used for the hero text, paragraph sections and the footer.

- These fonts pair very well together and make the website appear both prestigious and contemporary. They make a good combination of tradition and modernity.

- Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Imagery

- For the website I used impactful images to attract the user's attention and to try to influence user's decision to visit one of the national parks.
- I paid attention that the images match the captions and are labeled with keywords important to the website content to improve onsite SEO.
- All images are sized and compressed for the best user experience.

### Logo

- I used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to design the custom logo. 
- The logo was inspired by Japan, the land of the rising sun. A crimson-red circle inside which a map marker with a traditional pagoda is placed. In my opinion it well represents the theme of the website.

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/logo-130x133px.png" alt="Website logo" target="_blank"></h2>

### Icons

- Several icons will be used from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to improve the website's UX.

# User Stories Testing
## Visitor Stories
**As a site visitior, I would like to gain an understanding of the website's purpose from the landing page.**
   
   - A hero image, placed towards the top of a webpage gives immediately a first glimpse on the website's content and purspose.
    - Strategically placed headline also indicates to the user what is the websites purpose.

**As a site visitor, I would like to easily navigate through the site and find what I'm looking for with an ease.**
- A navigation menu is placed in the top left corner of the website. Originally I planned to just have a hamburger icon (without menu wording) but in this way it will be more obvious to the users that this is navigation menu.
<h2 align="center"><img src="readme-files/img-readme/us-2-menu.jpg" alt="Website's navigation menu" target="_blank" width="50%" height="50%"></h2>

- When the user clicks on the hamburger icon, a full overlay navigation appears which allows the user to easily access any section on the website.
<h2 align="center"><img src="readme-files/img-readme/us-2-overlay_n.jpg" alt="Back to top arrow" target="_blank" width="50%" height="50%"></h2>

- Back to top arrow button appears on the lower right of page when the user start to scroll down the page. Once clicked, it jumps to the top of the webpage which reduces the time to manually scorll up the website.

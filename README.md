## Strategy
### Project Goals
- To enable easy access to the information needed about national parks to plan the trip.
- To show the most beautiful national parks to visit.
- To provide the information on how to get there.
- To ensure the users can get live weather forecast.

## Structure
The website is designed to be pleasing to the eye, consistent and user friendly.
- Interaction Design
    - Consistent design will be used throughout the website to maintain a good UX.
    - The overlay navigation with effective background image will make the website look elegant and attractive.
    - Animation effect
    - Consistent color scheme and effective images will be used to let users focus ...

- Information Architecture (IA)
    - The project was conceptualized as a one-page website, consistion of three sections. This structure was used because it is simple and familiar to the site visitors and it is sufficient for all user stories. 
    - consists of three main sections, the visitor will have a brief review of the entire webpage. In this way the user will never have to make more than three clicks to access the information she/he is looking for.
    - The content is organized and categorized by importance from top to bottom and left to right (navigation).

## Skeleton
The wireframes were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## Design
### Colour Scheme

The traditional colours of Japan will be used for the project, primaliy variations of red and white.

- Venetian Red (#C60A09)
- Red Pigment (#F23332)
- White (#FAFAFA)
- Seashell (#FFEFEB)

According to the article [The Traditional colors of Japan](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/color-in-japan/) red colour is associated with authority and wealth.
red is considered the warmest and most contradictory of the colors.

White is godly and pure

flag of Japan is a rectangular white banner bearing a crimson-red circle at its center
land of the rising sun.

White represents purity or innocence

the shades of dark brown were emphasized throughout the website. 

- A  was used for navigation and footer sections. 
For the background I used .... colour which I alternated with the white colour to create defined sections when scrolling through the website. Furthermore, the light background works well with the dark brown text due to its contrast.

- For the buttons I used

### Imagery

- For the website I used impactful images to attract the user's attention and to try to influence users decision to visit one of the national parks.
- I paid attention that the images match the captions and are labeled with keywords important to the website content to improve onsite SEO.
